# MixTape

The love child of Befunge and Brainf*ck

## Idea
MixTape is an attempt to create a new and fun esolang.

The idea behind it is a Befunge-like language that instead of using a stack as it's memory model uses a Brainf*ck like tape.

A Tape is a 1D grid of 256 cells that can hold a byte (0 to 255).
